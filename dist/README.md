Day 14 at The Iron Yard:

Our assignment was to build a photo gallery single page application with 3 different view:
  - One for all albums
  - One for all images in an album  
  - One for an individual images

This assignment was our first weekend-long assignment using JQuery. I did get stuck a few times trying to render the correct information on the page based on the hash location.
